# resume
This is my resume website that I made as a freshman Electrical Engineering student during Fall of 2022
I am now updating it as of August 2023 to prepare for the upcoming application season, hoping to have more success.
The actual site can be found at https://z4chh.github.io/resumesite/ (who am i kidding, you came from there)
